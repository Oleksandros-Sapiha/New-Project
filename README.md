<h1> Welcome to that text file, there would be a link below that would redirect you to the site itself, but before that I could explain some stuff </h1>

<h2>That site is supposed to be a project I have to finish on my online lesson, and it's about being a portfolio of mine, ofc, based on the fact that it's a project, it would lack functions and other such stuff, cuz it's only used for me as a example of how I should make a site that would exceed it's expectations in performance and other stuff which is important </h2>

<p id="Final-text">Despite that, criticism is allowed btw</p>
